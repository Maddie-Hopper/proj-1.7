            <h2>Solo Hiking Tips</h2>
            <h3>“Know the Trails. Respect the Land. Watch for the Signs.”</h3>
            <p>Hiking at Elder Glen National Park is a rewarding and unforgettable experience. To ensure your safety and enjoyment, we’ve put together a list of useful tips. Some of these may seem unusual, but trust us—you’ll want to follow them.:</p>
        </section>

        <section class="solo-tips">
            <h3>BEFORE YOU START YOUR HIKE</h3>
           
            <ul>
                <li>Sign in at the Visitor Center. </li>
                <li>Check the official trail map. – If you receive a map with markings that don’t match the posted trail signs, report it to a ranger and request a new one. </li>
                <li>Choose your hiking partners carefully. – Make sure everyone in your group arrives with you. If there’s someone you don’t remember inviting, do not acknowledge them.</li>
                <li>Wear a watch, but not a digital one. – Time behaves differently in certain parts of the park. Analog watches tend to be more reliable.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>ON THE TRAIL</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Follow the trail markers. – If a marker appears newer than the others or doesn’t match the official colors, ignore it.</li>
                <li> If you hear footsteps behind you, do not turn around. – Keep a steady pace. Whatever it is will lose interest if you pretend not to notice.</li>
                <li> Avoid walking too close to the trees. – Sometimes the branches move on their own.</li>
                <li> If you find a set of stairs in the woods, do not climb them. – Rangers will handle their removal.</li>
                <li>If the woods suddenly become silent, leave the area immediately. – Walk briskly but do not run. They like it when you run.</li>
                <li>If you lose your group, stay where you are. – If they do not find you within an hour, call the Visitor Center. If your phone rings before you call, do not answer it.</li>
                <li> If you see a man wearing a ranger uniform but no name tag, do not speak to him. – Keep walking. He will not follow if you pretend he isn’t there.</li>

            </ul>
            <h3>IF YOU GET LOST</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> Do not follow voices calling your name. – Even if they sound familiar.</li>
                <li>Check the trees for markings. – If you find a symbol that looks like an eye, stay put. Help will come.</li>
                <li> Do not sleep. – No matter how tired you feel, stay awake until sunrise.</li>
                <li> If you find yourself back at the same spot multiple times, sit down and close your eyes for exactly 30 seconds. – When you open them, the path will be clearer.</li>
                <li> If you find a cabin deep in the woods, do not enter. – There is no cabin.</li>
                <li>If you make it back to the Visitor Center and something feels “off,” check your reflection in the window before going inside. – If your reflection is not facing the right way, wait outside until a ranger arrives.</li>

            </ul>
