            <h3>Field Note: Some trees have been found with human-like growths resembling eyes. Do not make eye contact.

                <p>Long, twisting, snake-like roots and vines that seem to shift slightly when unobserved. Found along the trunks of The Warden Trees and appear to be an extention of the tree itself.
