        <h1>Camping at Elder Glen National Park</h1>
        <h2>“Stay the Night. If You Dare.”</h2>
        <p>For the brave and adventurous, overnight camping is permitted in designated areas of Elder Glen National Park. Experience the unparalleled beauty of the park under starlit skies, but remember—the rules are there for a reason.</p>  
    </div>

    <p>Spending the night in Elder Glen National Park is a truly unforgettable experience. Beneath a sky untouched by city lights, the park offers serene beauty, crisp night air, and an ambiance unlike any other. However, the forest does not sleep when you do. Before setting up camp, make sure you understand the rules, recommendations, and warnings</p>

    <div class="rules-camp">
        <h2>CAMPING RULES AND GUIDELINES</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Stick to the designated campsites. – If you find an “unlisted” campsite with a perfectly made fire pit and a half-built tent, do not stay there.</li>
            <li>Follow "Leave No Trace" principles. – Pick up all trash, including food scraps. Do not disturb or remove natural objects.</li>
            <li>Respect wildlife. – Do not feed or approach animals. Store food and trash securely.</li>
            <li>Be prepared for the elements. – Bring appropriate clothing, rain gear, and a first aid kit.</li>
            <li> Do not camp alone. – Even if you’re an experienced camper, the Elders prefer groups</li>
            <li> Check your tent before entering. – Sometimes, there are things inside that weren’t there when you left.</li>
            <li> If you hear someone whisper your name from outside your tent, do not respond. – No one should be wandering at night.</li>
            <li>Do not accept gifts from the forest. – If you wake up to find an object sitting outside your tent, leave it there.</li>
            <li> If you find a trail that wasn’t there during the day, do not take it. – Some paths only appear at night. They do not lead where you think they do.</li>
            <li>Stay by the fire. – Darkness is not always empty.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>CAMPGROUND OPTIONS</h2>

       <div class="details">
       <div class="camp-options">
        <h3> Veilwood Campground (Family-Friendly, Closest to Visitor Center)</h3>

            <li>Features fire pits, picnic tables, and maintained trails.</li>
            <li>Some campers report hearing soft singing from the trees at night. This is normal and nothing to worry about.</li>
            <li>If you wake up to find a small stone circle near your tent, leave it undisturbed.</li>
