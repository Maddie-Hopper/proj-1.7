                                        </h2>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li> Swim with a buddy. – If you end up alone mid-swim, get to shore immediately.
                                            </li>
                                            <li> Do not open your eyes underwater. – Sometimes, there’s something looking back.</li>
                                            <li>If your name is called from beneath the water, do not respond. – You will be expected to follow.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>Do not stay in the water past twilight. – The park is not responsible for what happens after dark.
                                            </li>
                                            <li> If you feel hands grab your ankles, exit the water immediately. – If you feel nothing but see handprints later, leave the park. You have been marked.
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>

                                    <h2>Elder Glen’s waters are beautiful, mysterious, and waiting—but remember:
                                        Not everything that enters the water gets to leave.
