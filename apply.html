            <h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) About Working Here</h1>
            <h3> What if I see something I can’t explain?</h3>
            <p> You didn’t. Continue your shift.
            </p>
            <h3> Why do I need to provide an emergency contact who “will remember me?”</h3>
            <p> The Elders need to know if there is someone who will notice if you dissappear.</p>
            <h3> My shadow doesn’t match my movements. What do I do?</h3>
            <p>Take a 10-minute break. If the issue persists, report to management—but do not describe what you saw.
            </p>
            <h3>What if a visitor reports seeing something strange?</h3>
            <p>Reassure them that it’s just a trick of the light. Unless it isn’t, in which case, evacuate calmly.</p>
            <h3> What happens if I break protocol?</h3>
            <p>You will be sent to the Elders for review.</p>
