        <div class="testimonial">
            <p>⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ “The Whispering Pines Night Hike was breathtaking! The way the trees move in the wind almost makes it seem like they’re talking. Definitely a unique experience.” – Sarah L.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="testimonial">
            <p>⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ “The Lantern Walk was super atmospheric. Our ranger told stories about old settlers and disappearances, and at one point, I swear I saw someone standing in the trees… but no one else seemed to notice. Probably just a shadow, right?” – Mark R.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="testimonial">
            <p>⭐️⭐️⭐️ “Signed up for the Veilwood Excursion. Not sure what happened. The tour was great, but we stood in silence for like 30 seconds. But when I checked my phone, 3 hours had passed! Weird. Would still recommend it.” – David M.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="testimonial">
            <p>⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ “At the end of our hike, the ranger asked if we all made it back. We laughed, but then someone pointed out that we left with 12 people, but returned with 13. The ranger just smiled and said, ‘It happens sometimes.’ That was probably a joke… right?” – Unknown User</p>
